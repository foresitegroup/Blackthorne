<h1>Our Process</h1>
<h2>Bringing value</h2>

Blackthorne Partners adds value during all phases of plan execution. We consistently yield outstanding results for our companies and investors due to decades of experience and our expertise in the areas of due diligence and business development.<br>
<br>

We screen many opportunities and narrow them to a handful of great companies, resulting in potentially one or two investments per year.<br>
