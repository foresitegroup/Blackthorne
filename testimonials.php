"Our family spent 110 years developing and nurturing Schaefer Brush Manufacturing. So when it came time to sell the business, we wanted buyers who would respect that legacy and who would take care of our employees, who were like family to us. Blackthorne Partners offered us just that, along with the confidence that Schaefer Brush Manufacturing would continue to be a major international source of innovative brush solutions."<br>
<div style="padding-left: 40%; font-weight: bold;">&mdash; Harold Schaefer, former owner, Schaefer Brush Manufacturing</div><br>
<br>

"I would recommend Blackthorne Partners to any business owner who wants a transition process free of stresses and challenges, and who wants to deal with buyers who closely listen and go the extra mile to understand the seller's point of view. I appreciated their understanding of all facets of the business, which made the entire ownership transition process easy. Dealing with the team at Blackthorne was a pleasure."<br>
