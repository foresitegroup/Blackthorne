<h1>Company Overview</h1>
<h2>A clear plan, properly executed</h2>

Blackthorne Partners has a straightforward, clear plan when it comes to private equity investing:<br>
<br>

<strong>Invest in small businesses, and help them grow.</strong><br>
<br>

We accomplish this by:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Identifying small niche businesses that go unnoticed by many larger private equity firms.</li>
  <li>Ensuring the businesses meet our <a href="investment-strategy.php">investment criteria</a>.</li>
  <li>Providing capital and strategic support to help the businesses achieve their full growth potential.</li>
</ol><br>
